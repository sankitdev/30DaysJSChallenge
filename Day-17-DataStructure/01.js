// Day 17: Data Structures
// Tasks/Activities:
// Activity 1: Linked List

// . Task 1: Implement a Node class to represent an element in a linked list with properties value and next.
// . Task 2: Implement a LinkedList class with methods to add a node to the end, remove a node from the end, and display all nodes.

// Activity 2: Stack

// . Task 3: Implement a Stack class with methods push (add element), pop (remove element), and peek (view the top element).
// . Task 4: Use the Stack class to reverse a string by pushing all characters onto the stack and then popping them off.

// Activity 3: Queue

// . Task 5: Implement a Queue class with methods enqueue (add element), dequeue (remove element), and front (view the first element).
// . Task 6: Use the Queue class to simulate a simple printer queue where print jobs are added to the queue and processed in order.

// Activity 4: Binary Tree

// . Task 7: Implement a TreeNode class to represent a node in a binary tree with properties value, left, and right.
// . Task 8: Implement a BinaryTree class with methods for inserting values and performing in-order traversal to display nodes.

// Activity 5: Graph (Optional)
// . Task 9: Implement a Graph class with methods to add vertices, add edges, and perform a breadth-first search (BFS).
// . Task 10: Use the Graph class to represent a simple network and perform BFS to find the shortest path between two nodes.
